                    Happy Generations & Datta Kaka

                    According to Datta Kaka, Gondavle is a Producer of Happy Generations and Datta Kaka himself was Happy Soul of Gondavle’s own Production. He devised many formulae for happiness, guided and dictated many books on Happiness for common-man in his problems. He was a saint of common man. No issue of a common man’s life is left unsolved by him by giving practical and easily doable solutions. He used to speak Hindi, English and Marathi.

                <Typography component="div" className={styles.fontFamilyAbout}>
                    He used to elaborate Gondavlekar Maharaj’s major sentences like:

                    The Ram who wishes to live in a temple only and is afraid to come to your house, into your day-to-day problems, is practical of no use to even worship by visiting the temple. This means he used to indicate divinity in one’s day-to-day life.

                    One who needs happiness can always get it at any moment.

                    No temple can help you, No tomb will help you, only Nama taken by you will come to your rescue.

                    There is no need to change the world which is experienced as disturbing to your happiness; but if you change then you will find that the same world has changed and become a  different world, a Happy World.

                    Without needing a change in the given situation, Ram Nam can make you happy.

                    Vacancy at the top, the crowd at the bottom.

                    Going to the top in whatever you do, is the key to achieving all in life instead of going after many things simultaneously.

                    Mr. Pundalik and Mrs. Indira Bai Kulkarni was blessed with their third child who was named as ‘Dattatray’ in a small town named Chikhali (District Buldhana) on July 10, 1942. He later was popularly known as DP Kulkarni among his colleagues, DP to many of his fellow Guru-Bandhus, Datta Bhaiyya for peers, Datta Kaka for youngsters, Kulkarni Saheb to LIC people, Nam ghenare [Nam Chanting] Kulkarni, Datta Aaba for children, Datta Ajoba, Namyogi Datta Kaka for disciples, Nampremi Datta Bhaiyya and so on... These were four siblings - eldest of them being Mr. Janardan (aka Bapusaheb), then came Mr. Vasudev (aka Babasaheb), then Datta Kaka himself and his beloved younger brother Mr. Govind.

                    The entire family was a staunch follower of Shri Gondavlekar Maharaj (aka Shri Maharaj). At the tender age of 7 years, Datta Kaka received ordination (दीक्षा in Hindi, अनुग्रह in Marathi) from Shri Maharaj. Then happened a meaningful event - Shri Maharaj asked this kid, “Will you follow me” to which he firmly replied - “I will follow you and only you.” This was literally followed in words and spirit by KAKA all through his life. At that moment itself, KAKA knew that it was only Shri Maharaj who understood him inside out, who was capable to guide him and help him attain the ultimate goal of life - Satchidaannanda.

                    He had a strong determination to devote his life to serving Rama (Ram-Seva) and to take forward the work of Shri Maharaj encouraging people in adoration of God. The commitment to the said mission was so powerful that he stayed bachelor. Besides Office and rest hours, he used to continuously chant Rama-Nama. He used to read, meditate and contemplate literature of Shri Maharaj - Shri Sadguru Lilamrut and The Discourses of Shri Maharaj; listen to audio cassettes of Shri Baba Belsare, take notes and study, and focus on continuous learning. Meanwhile, many people visited him and got guidance. He used to contribute his service to the Hospitality Department in Utsavs (Holy festivals) held at Malad and Gondavle and take incessant Nama.

                <Typography component="div" className={styles.fontFamilyAbout}>
                    Rather than limiting themself to starting and maintaining their own family he had a big family of thousands of members with different surnames and separate addresses. He maintained a fine work-life balance and taught an ambitious generation that it was not required to let go of their ambitions/desires/dreams to be able to do Parmartha (to attain God & Ultimate Happiness), rather Datta Kaka set an example by doing Parmartha and achieving everything in life simultaneously; thus indicating that by taking Nam and being successful in Parmartha has its overflowing effect on Prapancha, again proving  A Hero is Hero...  These practical teachings of his; motivated the then youth to achieve what they want in life as well as Parmartha. He ignited the urge among an individual to become successful in one’s life, guided continuously on how to study well and appear in competitive exams, to ‘Go on TOP’ and how to live a Permanent Happy Life in the remembrance of God. He used to say that Parmartha is not a credulous’ cup-of tea. One has to be smart and intelligent to be able to see and acknowledge God’s hand in one’s life. Even if one is not smart enough, the beauty of chanting Ram Nam is that it makes chanter smarter, wiser, to experience God in life and so become very relaxed and contented. Rather it is the easiest, safest, and cost-free method to become smart and wise in life.

                <Typography component="div" className={styles.fontFamilyAbout}>
                    By listening to the problems of people and giving solutions to those problems made people’s minds free of their internal friction. This in turn made people smarter and more receptive to God’s role in their life. When one gets a solution to his problems, he is ready to invest his time in doing productive things. This way his mind becomes open and happy. A happy soul would automatically take nama and thank God for all his blessings. He believed in the philosophy of “Teaching the Art of Fishing” rather than feeding with a fish. So initially he seemed to give solutions to one’s problems but later the person oneself with one’s open and receptive mind aided by Nama and blessings could find solutions for oneself and become an independent Happiness Seeker. He never believed in, nor did he encourage superstitious activities or irrational behaviour or never did he suggest any solutions which were anything but easy to follow. He and his teachings were/are very practical, logical and sustainable, time-tested, universal and very much achievable.

                    Pan India Samuhik Upasana
                </Typography>


                <Typography component="div" className={styles.fontFamilyAbout}>
                    During his stay at Indore since 1981, he started Samuhik Upasana (Collective Worship/Prayer) every Sunday 9 to 10 am. People used to besiege Kaka post upasana for listening to the stories and learnings that Kaka used to share about Shri Maharaj. His knack of telling about ease of doing parmartha in a super practical way, in the most easy words, helped many youngsters to achieve on both dimensions of life - Prapancha as well as Parmartha. As a token of acknowledgement of his works, in 1983, Shri Dinu Mama Ketkar (son of Shri Tatya Saheb Ketkar) offered the holy footwear (Paduka) of Shri Maharaj to Datta Kaka which Datta Kaka endured with the expected sense of responsibility, love and care.

                    Every bee (human being) that came near Kaka, got the divine nectar of Ram-Nama. He gave the formula - “Take Nama and Be Happy”. Where there is happiness, there is Maharaj (God) hence Earn, Sustain and Increase Happiness. Happiness is something which when given out does not reduce from the givers hand and when received does not fall short in the receivers hand.

                    His eyes were never judgemental, rather benevolent and ready to shower blessings on even those who were not welcomed by society. He accepted them and helped them to take nama and be happy. Many people changed in his company, their ill habits got cured, learnt how to live a happy life, their homes became heavens! He never publicised Nama but spread the urge to take nama and be happy.

                <Typography component="div" className={styles.fontFamilyAbout}>
                    In Kolkata, Shri Maharaj had conducted Hari-Haat (Sort of Fun-Fair) wherein people worshipped God in the way they wanted to - like humming holy songs, bhajans, Sanskrit canticles, Ram-Nam, playing fugdi, cooking various delicacies to God, and then donating the same as prasad to those who were present there, etc. Same way, a Hari-Haat was organized at Mandleshwar (Madhya Pradesh) on the completion of the Resolution of chanting Ram-Nama for 13 Crore times. Such fairs were a celebration of the accomplishment of a Resolution (Sankalp)as well as a motivation for the next Resolution. People started loving chanting Nama and requested Kaka to visit their homes and give them a chance to welcome him. This way many Upasana Kendra (centers for prayers) came into existence wherein people continued the practice of praying, becoming happy, and making others happy. Kaka guided on how the format of prayer should be. A fine blend of Jaap (chanting of Ram-Nama), Prayer, and reading of the Discourses by Shri Maharaj. He ensured to avoid monotony in the prayer and welcomed innovative ideas to make Upasana more enjoyable. These Upasana Kendras got their motivation to take resolutions (Sankalp) of chanting Ram-Nama. The theme of this activity was that when like-minded people unite for one Resolution a Group Power comes into existence and that Power helps generate positive and happy vibrations which ultimately attract more positivity and happiness - which is the real hunger of any living thing

                <Typography component="div" className={styles.fontFamilyAbout}>
                    Now Datta Kaka was not just an uncle for people, now his divinity was overflowing, bestowing upon others all the blessings and divine complaisance (anugraha). This became more evident in the Utsav (Festival) of Buldhana in 1993 conducted on the accomplishment of the Resolution of Chanting Rama-Nama. It became a grand pilgrimage. A grand cortege was happening to have Shri Maharaj and Shri Prahlad Maharaj Portraits in a palanquin, where various people urged Datta Kaka to give them complaisance (Anugraha) . Kaka knew his role and understood that all the people cannot afford to go to Gondavale, and in case going to Gondavle gets prolonged, why to waste that time, rather one should start taking Nama as soon as possible, as soon as his conscience allows him to get aligned with Maharaj (God). So Kaka did not avoid giving people anugraha. Every segment of humanity wanted to be participled with Kaka - be it poor or rich, be it a man or a woman, be it an aged or a kid, be it wise or ignorant, be it anyone.  Kaka accepted everyone without any reservations.

                    One thing ignites curiosity, what was it that brought so many people, from different ages, gender, intellectual levels, to Kaka... It was his knack of telling Shri Maharaj’s teachings, the importance of chanting Rama-Nama on the backdrop of contemporary happenings, technology, and relatable work-related experiences. Since he had himself lived by the teachings of Shri Maharaj, he knew every nuance of how to apply the teachings of Shri Maharaj helps one in every walk of life. The magical ingredient of his training was  - Humour. He used to explain deep and enigmatical concepts of Parmartha by citing simple humorous situations/examples which came out from our day-to-day lives themselves. This not only solved the day-to-day problems but also helped increase faith in Shri Maharaj. Anyone who came with problems and teary eyes to Kaka would leave Kaka with a broad smile on his face and confidence and love at heart. He used to say, “ My job is done, there is no need to get upset and disappointed by little things in life.  We make a fuss of little things out of our imagination, which leads to disappointment only and we stay devoid of the Real Happiness which is out there for us. We should remove the needle of a negative thought by simply providing another needle of a positive/happy thought and thus both needles slip away..”

How to deal with the internal questions - be it materialistic or spiritual, or how to behave in everyday life while protecting our happiness, how students should undertake their studies as to achieve their goals, how the youth should go to the top of the field they are working in, how relationships of a family may be nurtured with understanding and love - be it husband-wife or mother-in-law and daughter-in-law, effective parenting, all these aspects and whatnot, have been given guidance on which have been threaded in various books like “Let Understanding be the Law”, “Excuse Taxes”, “Misery Killing”, Books for guidance on how to study and excel for students of 10th and 12th class and “Yash Express”, etc.  Originally written in Marathi, some of these books have been translated in Hindi, English, Kannada, and Bengali. Since these books have been written/compiled by different individuals, it benefited them as they were in the process of compiling the book, they got to experience the teachings of Kaka.

                    One who has come to this world has to leave one or the other day… Thats the rule of this world.. But Kaka has made a difference in so many lives of people by being alive through his teachings, his guiding words, his Happiness oriented thoughts, and the attitude that one should behold to be able to Be Happy and Make others Happy.. He used to say, “ If you put a scent on your wrist, people will enjoy the aroma, and since the wrist belongs to you, you can anytime enjoy the fragrance..” Though He left this world physically on May 17, 2012, he stays alive in our hearts even today. He had specifically mentioned, “I will remain alive in your Smile”. It is said that Saints are not limited to their physical existence rather they remain alive through their teachings. One who implements those teachings in one’s life, can experience how the Saint’s/Guru’s/ Satguru’s mighty hand is continuously helping him, for making him happy, for taking him towards permanent happiness. One should hold on to the rope of faith and enjoy the allotted lot because for him only THE BEST IS HAPPENING!
